# binarySeries: A Low-Level Binary + Rust Learning Repo

## Purpose

**binarySeries** is a deep learning project to understand binary computation and system logic through Rust.

It works alongside the 3-part series on [lukefi.com](https://lukefi.com/).

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lmpkessels/binarySeries.git
cd binarySeries
cargo test
```

Navigate through folders by topic.

---

## Folder Structure

```
src/
├── adders/
├── alu/
├── complement_logic/
├── flags/
├── gates/
├── multi_bit_logic/
├── operators/
├── routing/
```

> Each folder contains its own logic and tests.
> Run `cargo test` to validate any module.

## Roadmap

Planned before freeze:

- [ ] Final cleanup of code and notes

After this, the project will be archived as a complete learning snapshot.
